# cognitive-aether
Python framework for development of classical and advanced energy detection solutions in cognitive radio networks.

This framework offers an environment to generate OFDM data, transmit it over different channels (AWGN slow fading, Rayleigh, Rice) and receive it with channel distortions.
All processed signals (Gray code, OFDM TX, OFDM RX, noise, convolved) can be saved in pandas DataFrames and CSV files.

NOTE: The development of this framework is in progress and more futures are about to come.
